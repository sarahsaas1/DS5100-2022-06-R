Hi, everyone! My name is Griffin McCauley, and I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia.
I attended the Paideia School for my entire primary and secondary education.
Following that, I headed to Providence, Rhode Island to complete my undergraduate studies at Brown University.
While there, I majored in Applied Mathematics and Economics and received a B.S. and B.A., respectively.
I am now hoping to enhance my domain expertise in these areas by gaining a robust Data Science skillset through this Master's Program.
One of my main goals for this year is to secure a position at Nike :)
