Hello. My name is Minah.
I was born in Seoul, South Korea.
When I was 2-4 years old I lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Afterwards I was in Daejun & Bundang, South Korea for a few years.
From 1st grade to 5 grade I was in Champaign, Illinois. 
I lived in Yongin, South Korea for the remainder of my childhood and adolescence. 
Once I hit college age I applied to schools in Hong Kong, Singapore and the US.
I did my undergraduate at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, because I wanted a liberal arts education.
I studied psychology and environmental studies.
After graduating I worked in New Haven, Connecticut at an autism research lab for a few months before my PI moved our lab to Seattle, Washington.
After working in that lab for three years, I started graduate school in Charlottesville.
I study social cognitive neuroscience and epigenetics.
