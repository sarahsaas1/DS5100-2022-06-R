I was born in Gyumri, Armenia. and grew up there until I graduated from high school. 
Afterward, I lived in Virginia for a year as an exchange student. As I returned to my home country, I started persuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the American University of Armenia.
Currently, I live in Chartlottesville, Virginia, attending UVA for a Master's Degree in Data Science. My goal is to become a professional in the field and make significant progress in my career.
