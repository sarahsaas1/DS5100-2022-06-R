    "A salesperson at a large tech firm is faced with a new payment structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "This salesperson has a quarterly quota of $225,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment received follows a progressive schedule with four brackets as follows:\n",
    "1. For the first 40% of quota, the salesperson receives 7% on quota reached\n",
    "2. For the next 30% of quota, the salesperson receives 10% on quota reached\n",
    "3. For the next 20% of quota, the salesperson receives 13% on quota reached\n",
    "4. For the next 10% of quota, the salesperson receives 16% on quota reached\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the salesperson is 50% to quota, reaching \\$112,500 of sales, then:\n",
    "- `a` = the first 40% is paid out at 7% (payout = \\$225,000 * 40% * 7%)\n",
    "- `b` = the next 10% is paid out at 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "The total payout to the salesperson would be `a + b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice what does NOT happen: getting to the second bracket does NOT mean the payout is \\$225,000 * 50% * 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This schedule represents earnings up to 100% of quota. \n",
    "\n",
    "We ignore sales above 100% here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, the salesperson would like to know how much she would earn if she reaches a given percentage of quarterly quota.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The quota structure in this assignment is analogous to how the US tax system works: There are several **brackets** with rate i applied to dollars in bracket i. \n",
